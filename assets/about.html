<p><h2>About</h2></p>

		<p>The 21st century has heralded an increasingly knowledge-driven environment. To stay relevant in this
		new world, India must continue to expand access to higher education while preserving quality and
		reducing costs. This situation is not unique to India, but given its enormous size and unique position,
		our challenges are formidable. Indian higher education has expanded rapidly in recent years as a
		response to rising demand. While this has widened access to universities, it has further reduced
		(already low) per-student spending and aggravated acute faculty shortages. Further, given the highly
		fragmented nature of India's higher education space, choices available to students (in terms of
		courses) in Indian universities are limited. Most students are not able to pursue their individual
		interests due to the absence of a wide range of courses.
		</p>
		<p>Digital technologies offer innovative solutions to address many of these challenges. Blended
		learning, aggregation of demand across institutions spread all over the country, 'hub and spoke'
		model are several models that can be used to enhance the students' learning experience. Integration
		of massive open online courses (MOOCs) in the curriculum can improve students' choices.
		Technology can be deployed for faculty development on a large scale. Using virtual labs, we could
		reduce the investments needed in experimental facilities across the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			Recognizing the importance of using technology in education to address several of the country's
		challenges in its higher education sector, the Government of India had launched the National
		Mission on Education through Information and Communication Technology (NMEICT) in 2009. After
		starting with a focus on providing technology infrastructure (in particular, connectivity and low cost
		access devices) and creating e-content, National Knowledge Network (NKN) has now helped provide
		broadband access to institutions of higher education. A consortia-based approach is providing access
		to large volumes of scholarly publications, electronic databases and e-books to the students and
		faculty.</p>
		<p>For the effective use of e-content, the Mission promotes appropriate pedagogy for e-learning,
		provides facilities to conduct experiments via virtual laboratories, on-line testing and certification,
		on-line availability of teachers to guide and mentor learners, utilization of Direct to Home (DTH)
		platforms for inclusive access, training and empowerment of teachers to effectively use the new
		methods of teaching, learning etc. Educators from the country's premier institutions such as the IITs,
		NITs and Central Universities are providing leadership and support for various activities of the
		Mission. IIT Bombay is engaged in many innovative programmes and activities to scale up the use of
		technology in higher education. The Mission provides a unique opportunity to all institutions of
		higher education to develop and deploy e-content created by top educators in India and abroad and
		promote blended learning.
		</p>
		<p>
		Blended learning can be a boon to address faculty shortages and enhance quality of programs,
		complete faculty teaching loads, and improve cost effectiveness. To address the problem of
		providing quality education at scale, Microsoft Research has been working on several projects to
		understand how technological interventions can enable quality learning. These experiments are
		pivoted around blended learning (Massively Empowered Classrooms www.mecr.org),bringing quality
		content to students and faculty, automating the process of problem generation and grading, building
		tools/technologies to create compelling content and enhancing existing content such as videos
		(NPTEL) to make it more engaging and appealing to students. The Mission is also engaged with the
		British Council to learn from UK experience in use of technology in higher education. Several
		workshops and two-way visits have been organised.
		</p>
		<p>Overall, there are several initiatives and ideas around use of technology in higher education. In order
		to scale up the use of technology and make it widely used in the mainstream we need to connect
		various 'dots' and develop a coherent strategy and a robust implementation plan. It is in this context
		that National Conference on Use of Technology in Higher Education is being organised at IIT Bombay
		on 25-26 February, 2014. This conference would bring together various stakeholders â€“ academics
		and experts, the private sector, and the officials from the government and regulatory bodies with a
		view to devise the strategy and action.
		</p>
		<p>The conference would primarily focus on improving the learning outcomes of students, empowering
		them by increasing their choices, understanding and addressing the issues faced by faculty, and
		would also examine the assessment and regulatory issues in the use of technology in higher
		education. This would help develop a blue print for the next phase of the National Mission on
		Education through Information and Communication Technology (NMEICT).
